# About me

I'm Dave, Head of Content at [Apify](https://apify.com)

We provide real-time web data for AI.

## What is Apify?

Apify is a platform for building and running Actors. 

Actors are a new way to package software tools to make them easy to develop, share, integrate, and build upon. They are based on Docker images, they accept a well-defined JSON input, perform an action, and optionally produce a well-defined JSON output. Actors are useful for shipping tools for web scraping, data extraction, MCP servers, and AI agents.

Apify has 8,000+ ready-made Actors in [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store).

## What I do

I manage the complete content pipeline and processes for Apify. That means strategy, systems, and execution across marketing, education, and user-facing content.
